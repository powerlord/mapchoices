For game plugins, we need the following abilities:

1. Flag to indicate the game uses frags.  HL2:DM only?  Possibly Neotokyo.
2. Flag to indicate that a game does NOT support game_end entities.
3. A way to override the round_end event.
4. A way of overriding these cvars:
   Bonus Round Time (CSS, CSGO)
   Win limit (Neotokyo)
   Frag Limit (for future use)
   MaxRounds (for future use?)
5. A method to swap team scores.
6. A method to call into CheckMaxRounds.
7. A method to override winlimit check.
8. A method to override when map vote takes place. (CS:GO Arms Race, CS:GO Deathmatch, TF2 MvM)

TF2 plugin requirements:
Hook teamplay_win_panel, arena_win_panel instead of round_end.
Switch team scores when TF2 internally swaps scores.  m_bSwitchedTeamsThisRound on gamerules?
Override winlimit check for MvM.
Additional winlimit checks as TF2 supports a variety of additional cvars.

CSS plugin requirements:
Override Bonus Round Time CVar

CSGO plugin requirements:
Override round_end to not process for Arms Race and Deathmatch.
In round_end override, check if clinch can cause a win next round and do a vote if it can.
Override Bonus Round Time CVar

Nuclear Dawn requirements:
Hook round_win instead of round_end

Neotokyo requirements:
Hook game_round_start instead of round_end as round_end doesn't give us scores.
